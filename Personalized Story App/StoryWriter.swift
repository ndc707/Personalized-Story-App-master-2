There were two large doors, one to \(pp[2]) right and one to \(pp[2]) left. Being that \(nameThree) was still a bit out of it from being knocked out on the floor, \(np[2]) decided to ignore the unconscious people and walk towards the right door.

One of the 6 strangers said warily. \(nameFour) was mesmerized by the distant hum. Yes, it was definitely trying to tell \(thrdpp[3]) something. \(np[3]) walked further into the corridor to the left, hoping to find the source.

Little did they know what awaited them. \(nameNine) and \(nameTen) kept running until they emerged from the tree line. Before them was a rickety old bridge. The creature's screeches got louder, so they had no choice but to cross. \(nameNine) took the lead going as fast as possible while making sure \(np[8]) didn't fall. \(nameTen) quickly followed, however \(np[9]) wasn't as careful as \(nameNine). \(nameTen) lost \(pp[9]) balance and fell to \(pp[9]) death."

They could no longer hear screeching and stopped to take a breath until they heard a cry for for help. They ran towards it to discover \(nameOne) surronded by rats as big as canines. \(nameEight), acting upon instinct, drew a pocket knife from \(pp[7]) jacket and flung it at the closest rat. The knife barely scraped it’s skin and landed on the ground. The rat turned around and leaped at \(nameEight). Seeing this, \(nameFour) dashed away. Unfortunately, \(nameEight) and \(nameOne) became dinner."
