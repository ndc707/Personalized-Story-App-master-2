There were two large doors, one to \(pp[2]) right and one to \(pp[2]) left. Being that \(nameThree) was still a bit out of it from being knocked out on the floor, \(np[2]) decided to ignore the unconscious people and walk towards the right door.

Yes, it was definitely trying to tell \(thrdpp[3]) something. \(np[3]) walked further into the corridor to the left, hoping to find the source.

The creature's screeches got louder, so they had no choice but to cross. \(nameNine) took the lead going as fast as possible while making sure \(np2[1]) didn't fall. \(nameTen) quickly followed, however \(np2[3]) wasn't as careful as \(nameNine). \(nameTen) lost \(pp2[3]) balance and fell to \(pp2[3]) death."

They ran towards it to discover \(nameOne) surronded by rats as big as canines. \(nameEight), acting upon instinct, drew a pocket knife from \(pp2[2]) jacket and flung it at the closest rat. The knife barely scraped it’s skin and landed on the ground. The rat turned around and leaped at \(nameEight). Seeing this, \(nameFour) dashed away.

They were moving quickly. \(np[3]) didn't want to stick round to find out who it was. \(np[3]) tried to get up but the bush stated to close around \(thrdpp[3]) “Help!” \(np[3]) yelled desperately, “HE-” \(nameNine) heard a voice calling for help. \(np2[3]) sprinted in the direction of the voice. \(np2[3]) came upon a clearing where \(np2[3]) was sure the voice was coming from, but there was no one there.

Over here.” someone called in response. \(np[2]) found \(nameFive) and \(nameTwo) huddled over a bleeding \(nameFour). 'What happened to \(thrdpp[3])?' \(nameThree) asked.
